    "# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with Azure Text Analytics API\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves using the Azure Text Analytics API to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews. By integrating the Azure Text Analytics service, the program can evaluate the sentiment of user-provided movie reviews and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. The application sends review texts to the Azure API, retrieves sentiment scores, and presents the analysis results to the user."
